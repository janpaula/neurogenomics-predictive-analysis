# NeuroGenomics Predictive Analysis

Exploratory bioinformatics project focused on integrating simulated genetic features with phenotype variables to investigate predictive patterns related to neuropsychiatric traits.

## Objectives

- Practice genomics-oriented data analysis  
- Apply machine learning to phenotype prediction  
- Simulate workflows commonly used in psychiatric genetics  
- Explore gene–environment style feature integration  

## Methods

- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- R (statistical exploration and visualization)
- Bash (basic workflow automation)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Predictive modeling

## Motivation

This project reflects my transition into bioinformatics and computational neuroscience, with specific interest in psychiatric genetics, transcriptomics, miRNA biomarkers and gene–environment interactions. The goal is to build practical skills in genomics-oriented data analysis and predictive modeling, simulating workflows commonly used in neuropsychiatric research.
