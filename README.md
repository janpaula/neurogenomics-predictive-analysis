# Neurogenomics Predictive Analysis

## Overview

This project explores a simulated neurogenomics dataset combining genetic risk scores, miRNA expression, and environmental stress variables to model psychiatric symptom severity.

It reflects my transition into bioinformatics and computational neuroscience, with focus on psychiatric genetics, transcriptomics, and gene–environment interactions.

## Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis on neurogenomic features  
- Evaluate correlations between genetic, epigenetic, and environmental variables  
- Build a preliminary predictive model using Random Forest  
- Demonstrate an end-to-end bioinformatics workflow using Python and R

## Methods

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- Random Forest regression
- Correlation analysis
- Simulated dataset representing gene scores, miRNA biomarkers, and stress indices

## Results (Preliminary)

- Strong correlations observed between stress index and symptom severity  
- Gene score and miRNA expression contribute to predictive importance  
- Random Forest highlights multivariate influence of biological and environmental factors  

## Next Steps

- Implement statistical analysis in R  
- Expand dataset simulation  
- Integrate RNA-seq / miRNA-like structures  
- Add longitudinal modeling  
- Explore cloud deployment (AWS)
