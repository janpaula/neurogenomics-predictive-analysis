# NeuroGenomics Predictive Analysis

Exploratory bioinformatics project focused on integrating simulated genetic features with phenotype variables to investigate predictive patterns related to neuropsychiatric traits.

## Objectives

- Practice genomics-oriented data analysis  
- Apply machine learning to phenotype prediction  
- Simulate workflows commonly used in psychiatric genetics  
- Explore gene–environment style feature integration  

## Methods

- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- R (statistical exploration and visualization)
- Bash (basic workflow automation)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Predictive modeling
